# Github_Data_Dive_Guvi
1. Introduction
The GitHub Repository Explorer is an interactive web application developed using Streamlit. The app enables users to explore a dataset of GitHub repositories provided in the file repo_data.csv. It allows filtering based on programming language, activity level, and topics, and includes a suite of visualizations to provide insights into repository characteristics such as stars, forks, open issues, and more.

2. Methodology
This section outlines the methodology used to process the dataset and develop the web application.

2.1 Data Collection
The dataset (repo_data.csv) contains key information on GitHub repositories:

Repository Name
Owner
Description
URL
Programming Language
Creation Date
Last Updated Date
Number of Stars
Number of Forks
Number of Open Issues
License Type
2.2 Data Cleaning
The dataset is processed to ensure data quality:

Handling Missing Values: Rows with missing values were removed or handled as needed.
Removing Redundant Columns: Non-relevant columns like 'Unnamed: 0' (an index column) were dropped.
2.3 Data Transformation
For better interaction and visualization:

Dates: Converted fields like Creation_Date and Last_Updated_Date to a datetime format.
Numerical Validation: Verified numeric columns like Number_of_Stars, Number_of_Forks, and Number_of_Open_Issues for consistency.
2.4 Visualizations and Interaction
Interactive visualizations were created using Streamlit and Plotly:

Bar Charts: Top repositories by stars, forks, and open issues.
Scatter Plot: Comparison of stars and forks across repositories.
Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlations between activity metrics such as stars, forks, and open issues.
Pairplot: Shows relationships between metrics like stars, forks, and open issues for further exploration.
The application allows users to filter data by programming language, activity level, and repository topics, dynamically updating the visualizations based on these filters.

3. Application Instructions
3.1 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.7+)
Required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas plotly seaborn matplotlib
3.2 Running the Application
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Open the terminal in the directory where app.py is located.
Run the following command to start the application:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The application will launch in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501/.
3.3 Using the Application
The application offers several interactive sections:

Filter Repositories:

Filter repositories by selecting a programming language or viewing all languages.
Use sliders to filter based on stars, forks, and open issues.
Search for a repository by name or topic.
Filtered Repositories:

Displays a list of repositories matching your filters with key metrics such as stars, forks, and open issues.
Download Filtered Data:

A button is available to download the filtered dataset as a CSV file.
Visualizations:

Choose between various chart types:
Top Repositories by Stars
Top Repositories by Forks
Top Repositories by Open Issues
Correlation Heatmap: View correlations between key metrics.
Stars vs Forks Scatter Plot: Shows the relationship between stars and forks, color-coded by programming language.
Pairplot: Visualizes relationships between multiple activity metrics.


4. Key Findings
Using the GitHub Repository Explorer, we uncovered several interesting trends:

4.1 Repository Activity Levels
Repositories vary widely in terms of stars, forks, and open issues.
A positive correlation exists between stars and forks, indicating popular repositories often have more community contributions.
4.2 Programming Language Distribution
Languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java dominate the dataset.
Python repositories tend to have more forks, indicating higher community engagement.
4.3 Stars and Forks Relationship
A strong positive correlation between stars and forks was observed, confirming that as repositories gain more stars, they often receive more forks.
4.4 Open Issues
Repositories with a high number of open issues might indicate either significant community interaction or maintenance backlogs.
4.5 License Types
A large number of repositories were missing a license, which could be a deterrent for potential contributors


5. Conclusion
The GitHub Repository Explorer offers a powerful tool for developers and open-source enthusiasts to analyze the characteristics and activity levels of various repositories. By allowing users to filter, visualize, and interact with the dataset from repo_data.csv, the application delivers valuable insights into repository health, community engagement, and programming language trends.
